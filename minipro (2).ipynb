   \"your comment screams intj bro especially the useless part thanks for the information doesn interfere with anything ve ever experienced with infjs plus your signature is the lyrics from one of my favorite bands tool that song reflection was aren estps the kings queens of saying things without thinking without wanting to think no offense you guys can be fucking magnificent ooh so dangerous all these scary words and such no it not dangerous already knew was unhealthy before entered perc perc can make me more unhealthy lol what the fuck is that in your signature some obscure inspirational quote gone wrong why would that be implied there too many watch lot of tv shows although hardly ever watch them on tv how met your mother scrubs files futurama the office really getting into it recently the who to say that sensors will give birth to sensors or intuitives to intuitives the only reason why we think mbti is great is not because of its system the test is awful and people are very if you had the ability to time travel to 1933 and kill hitler would you john smith the dead zone by stephen king why kill him though if you have the ability to turn him into normal another interesting thing to mention is that mental issues disorders can cause physical pain and vice versa for instance long term severe pain can lead to insanity and depression is known to if you think physical pain is worse you haven suffered much mental pain personally do not think they re comparable of course physical pain is worse it implies irreversible damage and of course yoda would prefer si it all homestuck threads m guessing oooh dirk john or some shit his logic is pathetic and it fails to hold up so much of the time intp is definitely possibility but entp and maybe even enfp are as well mostly because see entps failing logically much more if were to actually pay attention to how walk then would end up walking normally so answering this question would be paradoxical think intps and isfjs have it the worst and m pretty sure ve got undiagnosed generalized anxiety disorder ew buzzfeed don really have many friends but can relate with an estp at first acted very estp like but it was fun acting stupid having fun saying stupid shit to each other but as the friendship would as well except would do it metaphorically read books all the time as kid don anymore it doesn matter if something is logical or not if it is boring as shit yeah it best because the first time you watch it you think it just demon bunny and how he reacts to it just amazing man love that profile picture when donnie gets that sickeningly satisfied face feel the same way so giddy m bit of sadist and love finding pleasure in dark things that how usually logic and ti has very little to do with answering trivia questions as it mostly has to do with memory however if don know the answer can use my ti to get an educated guess which is wouldn it be more economical to use regular phone in that case support this my phone has affected my life negatively more than d like to admit want to once again say that do not agree with this 24 type nonsense definitely think you can organize type into more specific types through answering questions mbti style but this just my intuition usually allows me to remember such answers in games like that even if do not consciously know anything about the subject being asked it things the subconscious has picked up on lol istp infj and estp gifs nice profile picture by the way laughing it has to do with the amount of time we have to think and respond lack of social stigmas no body language no external factors variables but agree if you can do it online you can do it in yes they make me angry for some reason in my high school there one that says speak your mind which find ironic yeah m probably quite less healthy than most intps and that saying something ve tried to get better but aspergers add anxiety alexithymia damn those words they make it hard for avoided death note why it meant for rationals mirai nikki isn that popular surprisingly maybe because it takes while to pick up speed not unlike death note and our world of sensors suppose but it not the same the likelihood of me finding an individual who like on the internet is indeed much higher but the amount of contact and relations can have with someone here is got 26 out of 37 the only good thing about soa is the opening theme holy shit the first few seconds are amazing though edit think the only times ve been emotional over an anime is the end of death note and he pretty rad but socially awkward and obsessed with logical correctness like more than me debating literally his ness but idk he creates arguments and plays devil advocate which is an just watched tabletop video on youtube and had the good fortune of seeing allison scagliotti for the first time think m in love anyways d say she an entp because of well more like sniffle you plastic funbag saw that earlier m not the biggest fan of markiplier spelling lol lot of his commentary and such seems to be mostly facial expressions and noises however m sympathetic of his past and d say water over rock maybe electric or dragon type fairy if we re fortunate m sure lot of immature intps would like to believe they have diminished emotions but emotions are human thing not including anti social personalities since your mbti is based completely off how you answer the questions would say yes and think you misunderstand mental disorders most people who are afflicted are still capable of most things m confused all it asks for is my birth date and location and then it tells me my theme or whatever didn even answer any questions wish had an intp friend i have not met single rational at this school besides the ones already know which is 2 intj who is too cool for me right now and entp for intps it serves us quite well remembering important factoids and info knowledge but never hygenial things feel like it most has to do with our subconscious intuition not exactly you re right there almost always solution and suicide shouldn be first on the list play it in spurts every now and again d say m okay my greatest weakness is that can think too many steps ahead can think of the best logical move for the board as it is maybe even 226530 topher brink of dollhouse like said everybody different and not having close friend does not equal being alone although it can seem like it you still have human contact which is really all that necessary did you make an account specifically with this in mind to ask lol\",\n          \"have this too though they re usually almost of psychic quality knowing m about to come down with something specific knowing something going to go wrong knowing what going to be on the think capitalism when controlled and complimented with social programs isn that horrible mean people can be entrepreneurs and blah blah blah but capitalism in its current sense people assertiveness decisiveness caring less about what people think motivation energy always feel like just kind of sit by and let my life happen and deal with it in the best way can my favorite games are always open world or map style games ones where you can explore and especially games where you can find secret areas secret levels secret items etc my all time faves are ve been gone for awhile hello infps always stopping and starting things my confessions 1 had the reputation of being slut in high school which ll deny to the ends of the earth oh no don feel bad for sure have anxious attachment issues figured that out not too long ago m trying to pinpoint if they have anything at all to do with my personality type or if i one of the odd ones out from my type that doesn have dreamworld so to speak constantly have songs random dialogue and images running through my head but don sit and imagine have had my share of self esteem issues like any girl however know do have self confidence just choose to be modest and humble to me there nothing less attractive than guy or assbiscuits between your name your post and the lolcats you just made me laugh okay so was pondering this one widely consider alone to include my husband and daughter e if m asked question about whether d rather be alone at home or at party enjoy as girl who grew up in very small town and moved to big city there are pros and cons like anywhere else noticed that loved the feeling of anonymity the city has to offer small it pretty much the way we do things in life focus on the things we care about dismiss the crap we don care about our minds are always spinning with something we care about therefore you well kurt cobain was an infp himself so there you go chance encounter click the title to go to the youtube video perhaps this song speaks to me so much because the hometown referred to is my hometown but check out the lyrics love the am really sorry you re going through this and can tell you have done it to many guy can explain it either the last thing ever want to do in this world is hurt someone but used to weird m libra too and can definitely identify with you pmj85 concur with the other ladies we infps can be weird love romantic gestures but even if m in the early stages of dating someone going overboard makes me feel smothered and want to run m how many cheese jokes do you get isildin lol agreatparade m exactly like you this is embarrassing but sometimes don check my messages all weekend many weekend goes by when nobody calls me and m so happy and content in my own danke ehre wo wohnst du in deutschland oder in andere land forgive me haven had german since high school haha m from the midwest and my accent when at it peak sounded like mix between minnesotan and canadian eh now that ve lived in the southwest for few years it faded lot when go thought perhaps that was what it was but she did say but seriously so took it seriously ve wanted to change my personality million times now that ve read more of these m really surprised at how much most of the ladies style is similar to mine thin airy fabrics classic not too revealing with delicate girly details love it hmmm let put it this way if had all the money in the world all the time needed to put together decent outfit and could wear whatever wanted everyday it would be something like that would be awesome especially if it were filled with all kinds of clues about who haunting it ve wondered the same thing but then realized why fight who you are we are very rare type so lot of others might think we re weird or not be able to relate to us we can pretend m agnostic to atheist basically don think that measly little human me has any idea what created this planet nor do have the right to act like do transcendentalism actually has my mother in law is definite estj the complete opposite of me demanding judging never quits working never quits finding something that needs to be fixed controlling everyone around her yes ve become very withdrawn over the years it so strange because in high school was social butterfly and always had to be somewhere doing something with someone always even though meak is your avatar pic from those scary stories to tell in the dark books the art looks very similar love the style tried that and it kept saying invalid url grr oh well hopefully somebody will be curious enough to click the links it opens the video in its own window no fuss thanks for trying to help thank you cards anyone m exactly like you when it comes to that if don do it right away realize it a little late get more and more uncomfortable and never send it don even anyone wanna enlighten me on how to post videos feel like an idiot please guys listen to mason proper and let me know what you think pretty sure the lead singer is one of us truly enjoy the melodies and the fanciful figurative lyrics sometimes chaotic and love this forum it makes me feel normal always think m just lazy disorganized piece of crap but guess we all are haha hood sounds like me m always so good about organizing at first and then lose interest traditional universities don really work for me either and my in laws want to pay for me to go no chose the restaurant the last 50 times you choose me but don care where we eat how do you think of these things quit saying you re sorry me sorry what did do in college focused on the classes liked put in 100 and got as and completely neglected those didn find interesting and dropped out to work instead m about to start again hahaha hey guess dice would work just fine as long as there some means of making decision without all of us being indecisive and afraid to step on eachother toes according to careerplanner com an infps job must offer meaning and value and it must be fun definitely identify with this think infps want choice in how their time is spent there is nothing worse to me anyway than feeling like m trapped doing something hate for 9 hours day honestly spend way more of my think we need hall full of decision makers we never be able to run the place ourselves with nobody to make quick decisions we also need lots and lots of space so we wouldn feel yes most definitely have gotten in the habit of having to create excel spreadsheets for everything or if want to decorate room can organize how everything going to look in my head so wow thought was an intp before and then came over here and this is one of the zillion things found that made me realize m all i most definitely live secretive lifestyle m we have our share of problems but have been in very happy relationship for over 6 years we just had our first little one m not sure how the rest of you are with relationships but m m somewhere between infp and intp and swear m psychic too many time have known what song was going to come on the radio next or had feeling should call someone just to find out hahaha nothingnew best cure ever found however being mom with baby can use it as my daily anxiety pill hope it becomes legal so don have to compromise my sanity to be sure ahhh are you antisocial like in the real definition of the word haha personally believe that while it would be ideal to exist without society and its rules it nearly impossible while am liberal and somewhere in the agnostic to atheist range just believe who am to even pretend know who our creator is think religion is man made and sometimes necessary for instilling thanks everyone he is healthy though definitely different personality type than me not sure which though he very loving and affectionate but also needs lots and lots of alone hobby time\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
